			<h1 class="party-description-2">During traditional festivals, people also gather with their family and friends to participate in various activities. They often come together to arrange flowers, brew tea, and may even organize flower arrangement events related to the theme of the festival. In addition, people play music and compete in piano skills together. Different festivals have different customs. For example, on the Lantern Festival, people take to the streets to participate in lantern fairs, watch acrobatic performances, make lanterns together, and set river lanterns afloat by the river. Finally, they invite friends and family to have dinner together.</h1>
