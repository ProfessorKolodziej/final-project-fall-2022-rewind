				<h6 class="party-des-1">During the Song Dynasty, people enjoyed a rich and varied leisure life. In their free time, they would gather with good friends for "Ya Ji," which were essentially social gatherings. The themes of these gatherings were diverse, with some of the most classic ones including spring outings, summer lotus viewing, autumn chrysanthemum appreciation and crab feasting, and winter snow appreciation with wine. These types of gatherings were more like literary salons where people would come together to appreciate poetry music, and more.</h6>
